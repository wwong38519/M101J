Homework: Homework 3.3 (MongoProc)

Making your blog accept posts
In this homework you will add code to your blog so that it accepts comments. You will be using the same code as you downloaded for HW 3.2. 

Once again, the area where you need to work is marked with an XXX in the BlogPostsDAO class. There is only a single location you need to work to insert comments. You don't need to figure out how to retrieve comments for this homework because the code you did in 3.2 already pulls the entire blog post (unless you specifically projected to eliminate the comments) and we gave you the code in the template that pulls them out of the JSON document. 

This assignment has fairly little code, but it's a little more subtle than the previous assignment because you are going to be manipulating an array within the Mongo document. For the sake of clarity, here is a document out of the posts collection from a working project that also has comments. 
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("513d396da0ee6e58987bae74"),
	"author" : "andrew",
	"body" : "Representatives from the planet Mars announced today that the planet would adopt MongoDB as a planetary standard. Head Martian Flipblip said that MongoDB was the perfect tool to store the diversity of life that exists on Mars.",
	"comments" : [
		{
			"author" : "Larry Ellison",
			"body" : "While I am deeply disappointed that Mars won't be standardizing on a relational database, I understand their desire to adopt a more modern technology for the red planet.",
			"email" : "larry@oracle.com"
		},
		{
			"author" : "Salvatore Sanfilippo",
			"body" : "This make no sense to me. Redis would have worked fine."
		}
	],
	"date" : ISODate("2013-03-11T01:54:53.692Z"),
	"permalink" : "martians_to_use_mongodb",
	"tags" : [
		"martians",
		"seti",
		"nosql",
		"worlddomination"
	],
	"title" : "Martians to use MongoDB"
}

Note that you add comments in this blog from the blog post detail page, which appears at
http://localhost:8082/post/post_slug
where post_slug is the permalink. For the sake of eliminating doubt, the permalink for the example blog post above is http://localhost:8082/post/martians_to_use_mongodb 
As a reminder, to run your blog you type: 
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=course.BlogController

Or, use an IDE to run it. 

To play with the blog you can navigate to the following URLs 
http://localhost:8082/
http://localhost:8082/signup
http://localhost:8082/login
http://localhost:8082/newpost
